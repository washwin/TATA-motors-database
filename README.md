# TATA-motors-database
# We have created a model database for TATA Motors Dharwad
# To initialize the database to your postgres admin run init.py using: python init.py
# Then enter the appropriate credentials
# This will create a new database called tatadb and fill it with the sample data given
# NOTE: running init.py also deletes existing tatadb if present
# Also, two users namely employee and boss have been created with restricted database access to them
# Use view.py to view tables present in the database
* Use update.py to update rows in tables
